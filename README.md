## Reflection
My team and I wanted to build a full-stack application and decided on our mutual love of music. When building the app we came across some challenges 
such as integrating the Spotify Web API, building the database, and securing the API routes and user info. Using provided documentation (and a lot of testing) we were
able to overcome these obstacles and release the application into production.

## Status
This application is finished.
